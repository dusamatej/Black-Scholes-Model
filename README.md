# Black-Scholes-Model
Real-Time Option Pricing Calculator
Using Black-Scholes Model, Historical Volatility, and Live Risk-Free Rate

# Project Overview
This project builds a simple yet powerful Python application that calculates the theoretical price of call and put options using the Black-Scholes model.

# The script dynamically:

  Fetches the current stock price from Yahoo Finance.
  Calculates the historical volatility of the stock based on recent price movements.
  Retrieves the risk-free interest rate by automatically matching U.S. Treasury bond yields to the user's expected option expiration time.
  Computes the theoretical call and put prices.

# How It Works

1. User enters the stock symbol.
2. User enters the number of years until option expiration.

# Program automatically:

1. Pulls live stock price.
2. Estimates historical volatility.
3. Pulls the matching Treasury yield as the risk-free rate.
4. User reviews the calculated theoretical call and put prices.
